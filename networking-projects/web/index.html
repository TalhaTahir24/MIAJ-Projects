            <h2>What is a DevOps Engineer?</h2>
            <p>A DevOps Engineer is responsible for bridging the gap between software development and IT operations. They work to automate and streamline the development, deployment, and monitoring of software. DevOps engineers use a combination of software engineering, systems administration, and cloud technologies to build scalable and efficient infrastructure, often using CI/CD pipelines and infrastructure as code (IaC) practices.</p>
